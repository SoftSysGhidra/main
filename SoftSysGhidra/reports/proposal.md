# Learning Ghidra and Reverse Engineering

*Caitlin Coffey, Zoë McGinnis*

### Background

---

Ghidra is a reverse engineering tool developed by the National Security Administration. It is free and open source, making it accessible to those who are interested in reverse engineering. The goal of this project is to develop an educational resource for other reverse-engineering amateurs to reference when exploring Ghidra.

### Project Goals

---

Our "definition of done" is to have a fully developed educational resource with an example reverse engineering exercise for people to tackle. Our resource will have information about how Ghidra works, how to install Ghidra, how to use Ghidra, and how to analyze the decompiled code. Depending on our time, our educational resource might contain more reverse engineering exercises. It might also contain information about how to safely analyze malware using Ghidra.

Here are our defined upper and lower-bounds for the project:

- *Lower bound:* Document the functionality of Ghidra/decompilers in the form of a zine. This would also include an exercise similar to solving a simple CrackMe. This would be similar to a smaller, more reverse engineering-focused version of *Think OS.*
- *Upper bound:* Use a VM to dissect malware and document our findings. In addition, we could also make an instructional video and/or add more exercises.

### Tasks

---

Our first steps are to research more about how Ghidra works, including how general decompilers work. Caitlin will look into this part. We also want to make a quick start guide for how to install and use the basic functionality of Ghidra. Zoë will create a basic guide about the fundamentals of Ghidra. Last but not least, we want to create a basic outline of our educational resource. Both Zoë and Caitlin will work on creating the outline of the resource.

### Learning Goals

---

Our learning goals are to learn more about how Ghidra works and how to use it. Furthermore, we want to make Ghidra more accessible to students that are new to C and assembly coding.

- Zoë specifically wants to learn how to use Ghidra to analyze recompiled code using more advanced tools within Ghira.
- Caitlin is interested in learning more about the process of how Ghidra decompiles an executable file and translates it into (somewhat) legible C code.

### Resources

---

So far we have found several video guides to solving simple CrackMes and analyzing malware using Ghidra. These are detailed on the Resources page of our team Notion, which can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/Resources-9f3a9fc01360493daab4724b90ecfa22.). (Long link: [https://www.notion.so/Resources-9f3a9fc01360493daab4724b90ecfa22](https://www.notion.so/Resources-9f3a9fc01360493daab4724b90ecfa22))

We both have Ghidra installed and have played around on it (Zoë has done a simple CrackMe and Caitlin has tested it out on executables from previous SoftSys homework).

We have also found guides that explain how to install, use, and analyze Ghidra. We will look at these closely to determine how to organize our instructional video.
